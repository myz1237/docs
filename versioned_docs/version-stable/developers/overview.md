If you are a coder, we invite you to build privacy enhanced applications - **PEAPs** - using Nym.

There are many different ways of utilising the anonymity properties the Nym mixnet and its associated technologies such as coconut offer developers, and numerous levels of the stack at which to start developing: 

* Mixnet Applications
* Hack on Nym nodes 
* Nyx blockchain smart contracts 
* Integrations with existing apps 

Some of these possibilities are only just becoming possible, and some will become possible in the coming months. 

## Mixnet Applications
Nym lets you build privacy respecting clients and services which use the Nym network infrastructure. Your apps can then connect to other apps also using the Nym network. All app-to-app communication happens over a set of cooperating networked nodes called a mixnet.

Mixnets give strong privacy guarantees against third-party observers.

It is apparent to any external network adversary that a given machine has connected to Nym infrastructure. Beyond that, it should not be possible to infer what activity is taking place unless there are observable network side effects (i.e. a Service Provider that makes network requests on behalf of a Nym client).

Since the network has only just reached the level that users can start to build meaningful applications on top of it, there's not much in the way of guides or how tos yet - these will be coming in the immediate future, so keep your eyes peeled! 
				
## Hack on nodes
If you're wanting to develop on top of the infrastructure code itself, and start adding additional features to existing nodes, check out the [Nym github repository](https://github.com/nymtech/nym). If you want to get to grips with running a node before starting this, check out the [Node Operators](/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/pre-built-binaries) section of these docs for more.  

## Nyx Blockchain
If you want to start by looking at the smart contract level, look towards [Nyx](/docs/stable/developers/develop-with-nyx/overview), and also have a look at the Nym `validator-api` [code](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/validator-api) to explore the possibilities.  

## Integrations with existing apps 
If you're building an application that you think could benefit from utilising the Nym network, get in touch via the Integrations channel on Discord.
